 # Indian Employee Data Cleaning using Pandas and NumPy

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a real-world Indian employee dataset
using Python libraries Pandas and NumPy. The goal is to improve data quality by handling
invalid and inconsistent values and generating a clean dataset for further analysis.

---

## Dataset
The project uses an Indian employee dataset containing issues such as:
- Negative salary values
- Missing values
- Infinite values

---

## Files in this Repository
- indian_employee_data(1).csv  
  Original uncleaned dataset containing missing, negative, and infinite values.

- cleaned_indian_employee data.csv  
  Final cleaned dataset generated after preprocessing.

- pandas & numpy project.py
  Python script using Pandas and NumPy to clean the dataset.

- README.md  
  Project description and explanation.



## Data Cleaning Steps Performed
- Identified and removed negative salary values
- Replaced infinite values with NaN
- Handled missing values
- Generated a cleaned output dataset



## Output
The cleaned dataset is saved as:
- cleaned_indian_employee data.csv

This file can be directly used for analysis or machine learning tasks.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical data cleaning and preprocessing techniques
required when working with real-world datasets.
